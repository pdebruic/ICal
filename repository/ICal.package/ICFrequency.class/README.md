This class is used to actually calculate the dates created from a given recurrence rule.  It does it's work by generating an infinite list of the given frequency and then intersecting that with each applicable rule.  Each subclass impliments the #periodsFrom: method to generate this list.  The #eventsStartingAt: method applies all the rules to the period list, creating a filtered list that intersect the two previous lists.

In this way, no specific rule needs any state, they get the set they will work on from the period list generated in the previous step.  That is, the period list is a list of start and end times.  A given rule must only generate a list of periods that are applicable between this start and end time, if any.

In the case that a given rule was not specified, the behaviour depends on the frequency.  For example, in a yearly frequency a rule from month, day, hour, minute and second is needed.  If these were not specified they will be taken from dtstart.  So for e.g. a month, the frequency period list is intersected with either a list of the specified months, or the month in dtstart.  However, for daily the month is not required.  In this case the #byMonths:withPeriods: method will either apply the specified months, or pass the period list it recieved if no months are specified.
